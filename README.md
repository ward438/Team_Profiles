# Team_Profiles

Team Profiles, through Node, allows a user to create an employee profile database. The user inputs( node index.js ) in the terminal to start the program. 
The user can choose to create a profile card for Employee, Intern, Engineer, or Manager. The user can input info such as office number, email, github, etc. 
based off of the employee category selected. 

Team Profiles utilizes JSON data and adds to the existing organized creations. Once the the program is finished, all of the data is collected and formatted to an 
HTML( index. html ). The profiles are displayed as cards and are labeled based on employee position. 

Be sure to ( npm i ) prior to starting the program. Once complete, open index.hmtl.
